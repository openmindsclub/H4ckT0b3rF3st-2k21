# AutoClicker

### 1. Description :
Autoclicker is a script made by OpenMindsClub to beat the CPS game at the website : https://cpstest.org/
this script was made for the purpose of learning the the pynput library so its far from being ready.<br>
Your task is to make it complete through some simple checkpoints<br>
### 2. How Does it Work : 
### Requirements:
- Python 3 : 
 ``` 
 $ sudo apt-get update  
$ sudo apt-get install python3.9
  ```
- Pynput :
```
$ pip install pynput
```
### How to run the script:
1.  put the window of your browser next to the VScode window<br>

2. using any image editing software take a screenshot and get the coordinations of the typing box then Run the script :<br>
```
$ python3 AutoClicker.py
```
### 3. Tasks :
As you see the script is lacking a lot of features to be usable, and this is what we need you to help us achieve !</br>
1. Use web scraping to locate the Click box 
2. Use multithreading to make the clicking stop at a specific period
3. Reach 100 CPS (clicks per second) in 30 seconds category
