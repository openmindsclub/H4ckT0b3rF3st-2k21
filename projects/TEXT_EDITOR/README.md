## Project description 

Are you tired of having a lot of text editors with the same functionality? <br>
How about coding your own text editor to your standards so that it meets all your needs quickly, automatically, and with just one click? Have you ever thought about that? 

## Your Task

In this project, we have already created an initial version of the text editor. Your task here is to modify it as you want by adding the functions you want to use.
