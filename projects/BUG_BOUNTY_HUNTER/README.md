C-Readers is a web application for book lovers. Which presents a collection of books to readers in a modern way.
But like other electronic libraries, it is exposed to malicious people, and sabotage of subscriber data. Do you think you can find and fix vulnerabilities in order to secure this web application and protect the privacy of our users? 

## Your Task

 <h3><u> Condition </u> </h3>
- It is forbidden to use automation tools to find vulnerabilities.
