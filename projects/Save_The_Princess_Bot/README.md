## Project description

A Princess is trapped in one of the four corners of a square grid. You are located in the center of this grid and you can only make one move at a time in one of the four directions of your choice. Can you save the Princess using the shortest past possible ?

## Your Task

In this project, we already created a simple path finding method using euclidian distance. Your goal is to create a more optimal function with a better complexity. the grid is 5x5 length, the position of the princess is in the Princess variable and the knight position is the Knight variable. Your function has to return a list of the x and y indexes of the cases of the grid of the grid that the knight passed throught to save the princess.  

## Requirements

Before starting 🏁, you need to have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.<br>
For linux users you may need to install python3-tk in order to use tkinter, just open a terminal and execute the command
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

## Starting

You can download this project only by running those commands :

```bash
# Create a directory, so Git doesn't get messy, and enter it
mkdir my-dir && cd my-dir

# Start a Git repository
git init

# Track repository, do not enter subdirectory
git remote add -f origin https://github.com/openmindsclub/H4ckT0b3rF3st-2k21/

# Enable the tree check feature
git config core.sparseCheckout true

# Create a file in the path: .git/info/sparse-checkout
# That is inside the hidden .git directory that was created
# by running the command: git init
# And inside it enter the name of the sub directory you only want to clone
echo 'projects/Save_The_Princess_Bot' >> .git/info/sparse-checkout

## Download with pull, not clone
git pull origin main
```
Or just download the whole repo using the command :

```bash
git clone https://github.com/openmindsclub/H4ckT0b3rF3st-2k21.git
```
Go to the SaveThePrincess.py file and copy past the YourFunction() function change it's name and start creating your funcion.

```Python
#After finishing your function replace FindThePath by the name of your Function

start(i,FindThePath()) ===> start(i,YourFunction())
```
Compile and see the result by using the compile button on your editor/IDE or by using the command

```bash
python3 SaveThePrincess.py
```
