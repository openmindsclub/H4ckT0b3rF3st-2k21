# Sort List Challenge

## Description

The challenge is simple, write an algorithm to sort a list of numerical values, using any programming language you want.
The use of functions such as `sort()` in python,... are not allowed, you need to write the algorithm from scratch.
The list can be sorted in the ascendent or the descendent order.

## Tasks

1. Write your algorithm in any programming language you want.
2. Add the file you created into this directory.
3. The name of the file should be `algo_name_user_name.file_type`, example: `bubble_sort_abdelhak_aissat.py`.

- If you create more then one file|(submit more then one algorithm) put the files in a directory with the same naming convention.
Example:
 Let's suppose you created 2 files: `sort1_abdelhak_aissat.rs` and `sort2_abdelhak_aissat.rs` you need to create a folder named `user_name`(abdelhak_aissat for example)
 and put them inside of it.

- If your sorting algorithm is not a standard one|(you don't know if it's a standard one), you are free! name it as you want.
