# Sounds effect challenge

You want to be the DJ of the fest, this challenge is for you.

### What's a sound effect?
A sound effect (or audio effect) is an artificial sound, created and used in the content of films, animation, video games, music, or other media.

### Guidlines
You are able to use any audio editor, tool or way to create and compose your sounds.
**Make sure** to credit any sound you used to create your music, if needed. You can check out some resources in the [Links](#Links) below.

- Compose your own music,(fantasy, action, drama, nature, fiction..etc) just unleash your musical creativity. 

- Try to simulate sounds of your choice, like the laughter of a witch, the sound of thunder, a sound that simulates hitting something, the sound of a penguin jumping ... etc.
- Put your sound in our folder and name it as username_musicname_sound.format (ex: openmindsclub_fest_sound.ogg)
- in case your music has credits, create a folder in this folder and name it as `/your_username` and put your sound and all necessary information there.

**Ps**: you can use [LMMS](https://lmms.io/) a free and opensource audio workstation, it gives you a huge synthesizer toolbox to play with.
