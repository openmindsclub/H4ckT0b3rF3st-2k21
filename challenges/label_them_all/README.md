# Label Them All

## Description

We always wanted to make an app that detect pokemons, but sadly we don't have the data for that, will you help us gather it? The challenge is simple, we have a collection of pokemon images on this drive [Pokemon Images](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yiJ_phwZA5Qzl7qEfZcPgrURpqG--wH9?usp=sharing) and you'll have to label some of them in the csv file `pokemon_names.csv` (or add your own in the in the csv file `additional_pokemons.csv`).

## Tasks
* Label an existing pokemon (name and type) on the drive [Pokemon Images](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1yiJ_phwZA5Qzl7qEfZcPgrURpqG--wH9?usp=sharing) in the csv file `pokemon_names.csv`.
* Add your own pokemon with a link to the image and the same labels.
