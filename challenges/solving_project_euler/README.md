# Solving Project Euler

## Description

Project Euler is series of slightly challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that aims to provide a platform for the inquiring mind to delve into unfamiliar areas and learn new concepts in a fun and recreational context.
Project Euler Problems are of varying difficulty levels, but solving them will highly improve your problem solving skills.

in This challenge you'll need to solve some Project Euler problems in any programing langage you like. You'll find the problems in [Project Euler's problems](https://projecteuler.net/archives)

## Tasks

1. Solve one or many Project Euler problems in any programming language you want.
2. Add the file you created into this directory.
3. The name of the file should be `username_problemID.file_type`, example: `aymenkhs_121.py`.

- If you create more then one file|(submit more then one algorithm) put the files in a directory with the same naming convention.
Example:
 Let's suppose you created 2 files: `aymenkhs_1.py` and `aymenkhs_2.py` you need to create a folder named `username`(aymenkhs for example)
 and put them inside of it.
